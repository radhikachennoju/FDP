Apple,I really liked the length of the cable and it also fast charging . It is original Apple charger so we can go for it.
Samsung,"I gave a 1-star rating not due to the phone itself, but because of the absence of a charger. It is frustrating that companies do not include chargers even with budget phones. This is a consistent problem I encountered, as even when I purchased the S21 FE previously, a charger was not provided. It is a serious issue that needs attention from the appropriate authorities to address. The lack of a charger with the phone purchase is becoming an increasingly common practice in the industry, impacting the overall user experience. It is concerning that consumers are expected to acquire a crucial accessory separately, adding inconvenience and extra cost to the buying process. The reliance on consumers having pre-existing chargers assumes a level of technological compatibility that is not always guaranteed. For the sake of customer satisfaction and usability, companies should reconsider this trend and include essential accessories with their products for a more streamlined and user-friendly experience."
